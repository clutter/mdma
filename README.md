MDM Agent
=========

Schedule deploys of the Clutter WMS app to all our iOS devices.

How to use
----------

[1] In [SimpleMDM](https://a.simplemdm.com/admin/apps) I created an app group that associates the [Clutter WMS](https://a.simplemdm.com/admin/apps/16714) appto all the devices where it has to be installed:

[2] On the [Show devices page](https://mdma-production.herokuapp.com/devices), you can see the list of all the devices in this group and the current version of the app:

[3] On the [Upload new build page](https://mdma-production.herokuapp.com/builds/new), you can upload a new .ipa file and set the deploy time:

[4] After the file is uploaded, the [Show builds page]() will present all your builds, with the scheduled ones at the top:

[5] Before the deploy time comes, the devices will still have the old version of the app:

[6] When the time comes, the app will be pushed to all the devices in the group. The [Show devices page](https://mdma-production.herokuapp.com/devices) will show the new version of the app.

How it works
------------

The app is hosted on Heroku and relies on one job run by Heroku Scheduler:

- `bundle exec rake deploys:enqueue` runs every 10 minutes and checks whether any build needs to be deployed soon
